# Of Dread And Defeat
An ode to ugly.
----

The afternoon sun breathed down on the city, its warm breath flowing through streets like veins providing life to the different regions of Downtown. Thom observed this network dreamily as warmth emanated from the glass next to him. He turned to it and observed the people inside. Important people – executives, shareholders, fathers, husbands… Real people. Out here it was just he and the wind, a relentless wind which treated most quite agreeably, but to Thom was not so benign. It would relentlessly whisper in his ear, humming a constant reminder of who and where he was. It was a sad, unsympathetic song reflecting a man that, as much as he’d like to be somebody, was just anybody.

Squeegee in hand, he smeared soapy, grey water over his subjects behind the glass with a grunt of contempt. There was no pride in washing windows for a living, only an enormity of time to think. Thought, Thom knew, is a hazardous occupation. Musing day after day on his pathetic existence had become a heavy and mounting burden, and burdens he had no shortage of. Painstakingly dragging his life’s cart through these many emotional mud-traps and potholes often left him staring down the throat of a sixty-two-storey solution. *But you wouldn’t do that,* he'd think with a sigh. *You’re weak. So work.*

Always a critical thinker, Thom enjoyed mental challenges and despised tedious repetition. In his mind, “tedious repetition” would forever be associated to with washing commercial windows. His workday began luxuriously enough: eight AM, he rolls out of bed, showers (as if it mattered), and slams back a cup of coffee while he irons his cover-alls (which somehow mattered). He picks up his lunch at Dave’s Meat and Grocery, and arrives at 1118 Watercrest Avenue for nine. *Not too shabby* thinks a lazy man, but the nine hours that followed were a broken record, a looping nightmare of squeegee action – dipping, soaping, flipping, and stroking. From time to time, he’d be blessed with the privilege of stopping to raise his platform, but after fourteen seconds he was doing it all again – dip, soap, flip, stroke, dip, soap, flip, stroke. It was eroding.

The other washers, however, spent their fourteen seconds *lowering* their platforms. Because the platforms were hitched to the roof over night, they must have thought it only made sense to wash the building from the top down. Thom disagreed. Thom knew that if he was anywhere near the top by eleven AM, he’d be far too tempted to close his eyes, let go, and allow himself to just fall back. He knew that one day, *that* would make the most sense, so instead he always worked from the ground up.

By now, he was staring through a window of the sixty-second floor at Crossroads Incorporated, a consulting company. It didn’t matter that he was looking in – no one could see him. He was a ghost. Everyone on the other side had tuned the washers out long ago.

*****

1118 Watercrest Avenue was by far the largest building on the Waterfront region of the city. Most of its structures barely measured four storeys while the Crossroads building covered one hundred and four. In 1988, this location must have somehow come off as strategic, as zoning was significantly cheaper and there was little else to be had so near the downtown core. But the building faced the ocean - more specifically, the sedimentary ridge next to the Pier. Winds poured in from the ocean onto the shore about as constantly as the water itself, and as it came up the rounded ridge, infinitesimal dust and sand particles came with it. No one told this to Crossroads when they sprung for curtain wall siding, eight hundred and thirty-two feet of nothing but tempered glass, which, from a short distance, had the reflective properties of a mirror. Should have, anyway. Throughout the day and especially overnight, a film of dust would collect so steadily and profusely that Crossroads had to employ a full-time staff of external custodians to maintain a professional image. (Thom found it amusing that a company you’d hire to think everything just plain hadn't) He figured having cleaners up there everyday didn’t look very professional anyway, but if the company had survived nine years, it couldn’t have been that damaging. There were eight cleaners total, each equipped with original Crossroads Inc. cover-alls (Thom’s nametag read *“Tom”*). Platforms harnessed to a system of tracks and pulleys on the roof were installed allowing full maneuverability up, down, and side-to-side across any one face of the tower. Of course, the company didn’t much care for the expense of such a stupid mistake, but it was probably what made the most sense economically – they were, after all, a consulting company.

*****

The other washers – Thom felt nauseous at the very thought of those grotesque beings. They considered things like hygiene, style and public decency to be somehow below their well-maintained world of sunglass tans and handlebar moustaches. Neon tank tops have not been flattering on anyone in a very long time, yet there these men were, perched contently on the side of the building like chuckling pigeons from a twenty-year-old metropolitan backdrop. Thankfully, he didn’t see them often; he shared a side of the tower with only Barry, whom he passed only once each work day. He was constantly surrounded by mirrors and reflections, so while passing Barry he was always careful not to glance to his right – he knew he would see the wavering reflection of a disgusting, middle-aged window washer named Thomas Pratt.

It had been about a half an hour since Thom passed Barry, now lamenting once more on his own insignificance. No one behind the glass would even subconsciously acknowledge him. They could sing, nap, even cheat on their spouses in front of him, and all without an ounce of shame. He mused on the windows. Maybe someone had made another mistake. Maybe someone installed the curtain wall backward and the inside was just oblique mirror. He’d never know, and that bothered Pratt the most.

Window washers weren’t permitted on any floor besides the lobby, and Thom rarely even went there. A service elevator ran from the underground parking garage all the way up to the roof, and the janitorial closet (at least the one he knew about) was there, as well. He was always either under, over, or outside the building, and never inside. He never would be, either: window washing had no place on the company ladder. Young men worked diligently in a mail room for minimum wage, always knowing that they were investing in a foothold on the rung above them. But window washers were overpaid grunts with no prospect. There were no skills or qualifications involved, no development of a resume (unless “wasted time wisely” had its merits). Even the mail room was out of reach to a window washer – no one could afford the pay cut, and a mail room job, as everyone knows, is always a product of nepotism.

So Thomas Pratt was going nowhere and with great effectiveness. Having no marketable skills or degrees to accompany an overly active imagination, he felt almost completely without option. His arsenal of wasted time was growing with enough momentum to continue for the rest of his life. Up there, alone with the thought of his wick burning away, he could feel the film he spent all his time cleaning collect on his soul, and, ironically, he had no idea how to make it go away. He lowered his head and looked down on the city below, listening once again to the whispers in the wind.

Abruptly, he tightened his grip on his squeegee and carried on working. He was beginning to scare himself. A plunge was seeming more and more inevitable. He frantically worked to busy his mind: dip, soap, flip, stroke. He hadn’t paid attention to his work for years and admired the mastery he’d achieved. Dip, soap, flip, stroke. Each motion without hesitation, without complication, just graceful execution. He could keep a good pace just as long as he wasn’t distracted. He had reached the end of his sixty-second-floor segment and proceeded to the sixty-third floor, which marked his shift to the third stage in the psychological journey that was his common workday.

Thom hadn’t realized it, but after over eight years of regularly washing the same wall of windows (before which he had graced the grills of pretty much every fast food chain in town), it had become so regular that each day he would reach the same levels at approximately the same time, cycling through the same emotional stages as he ascended:

*****

**Epiphany**. The realization that, yes, this is actually happening, and he is going to have to do it all again. The first twenty floors or so are composed of pathetic sulks and grumbles. 

**Harmony**. There is no point in arguing with the fact that he will have to work again today, just like yesterday, and just like tomorrow. He attempts peace of mind by hushing complaints and desperately experimenting with crude forms of meditation, biofeedback, and prayer to console his anxious nature. 

**Anger**. Sensibility and virtue are abandoned at the hand of complete frustration with his thoughts, actions, and environment. Bitterness toward his colleagues, himself, and his subjects behind the glass consumes him wholly - his primary defense against his own critical mind. 

**Fear**. Bitterness burns out and Thom reverts to a weeping child lost in fear. The day has been long and constant progress checks form a genuine fear that he will never actually finish. He knows his life to be worthless, pointless, and wasted, and doubts he will ever have the power to change that. 

**Relief**. Thom can finally look up in confidence, for what once seemed like an inverted abyss of mirrored hell has become a home stretch, a viable goal on the horizon. He rides out the rest of his workday feeling more refreshed than when he began, as if the air is somehow fresher and the setting sun somehow brighter. Nothing special will follow his achievement; he can only look forward to his snail-paced venture through the tunnel in his Geo and his TV dinner in his 19th Street apartment. But that is Thom’s proudest moment: he, alone, can stand taller than any man for miles, at the top of the mountain, bathing in the sense of accomplishment he constantly thirsts for. Even if for only a matter of seconds, Thomas Pratt is fulfilled, and he is humble enough that sweet seconds suffice.

*****

Thom was afraid. It wasn’t a violent fear, more of a doubt, but with something more. Doubt was always only one side of the argument, but he noticed all opposition steadily fade. Again, he listened to the wind as it continued to envelope his future under a layer of dust and sand.

*No,* he thought. *Stop. Dip, soap, flip, stroke.* He focused on the window. *Dip, soap, flip, stroke.* Inside, a well-dressed man admired a family portrait as he smoked a cigar. *How cliché.* Still, Thom felt empty. *Dip, soap, flip, stroke.* He looked away, up, at the shining ocean, his Everest, filled with fish that he would surely hate as well. He felt weakness in his knees and heart as he struggled with the tonnage of the blurring sight. *Dip, soap, flip, stroke.* The wind, his only companion, wailed in constancy, and he noticed thick cloud cover had begun to develop overhead. He looked down to escape the strangely appropriate sight and the wind picked up. It carried an air of defeat – a whisper, a thought, a seed implanted into his mind from which a black ivy crept down to his heart. He feebly fought theese poisoned emotions which clouded his senses, and tears began to develop in his aging eyes. He could feel the creeper continue to his limbs, constricting, teasing, and amassing. What was really happening? The washer could normally separate thought from reality. Couldn’t he? Well, reality wasn’t entirely missed. A forgotten tear dropped from his lowered head; it penetrated the day’s progress below him with insulting ease. He watched the poor drop with envy as it disappeared from sight, forever, never to be shed again. The pain that bore it hadn’t left, but it was no longer a part of it. Should he not be happy for it? Should he not pay respect to an end, by any means? 

Regaining some focus, he looked ahead once again at the fish that had blown smoke in his face. Could he not see Thom? Did he not understand the agony on the other side of the glass? Or did he simply choose to ignore it? For the first time, Thom thought his subjects weren’t ignoring just the washers, but the entire world. He once again thought about the windows being backward, with mirrors on the inside. He thought about these glass people, who lived in a beautiful sphere of ignorance and cold-hearted armour. He knew it was wrong, but he still wanted it. But there was no room behind that glass for Barry or Thom, for the ugly. He wanted to scream and pound on the window, force them to see and to accept, but to Thom that glass was completely impermeable.

His head was swimming. Nothing made sense and he could only hope that something would when he reached the top. He knew what needed to be done: dip, soap, flip, and stroke.

Whatever this deterioration of the mind was, it wasn’t completely merciless. The next forty floors were a dream where time seemed to lose all bearing. They became a blur of squeegee mastery, not performed, but patiently observed. Through tearing eyes and a blank mind, Thom employed the determination of a freight train, and a sense of urgency that might have met that of a desperate mother. He wasn’t certain how long it had taken him, but he suddenly found himself raising his platform onto its anchor. Thom noticed it had become dark.

Climbing onto the roof and taking dramatic breaths, Thom wept quietly. He’d conquered the skyscraper, the only one for a mile, and although he felt somewhat fulfilled, something was still different. It felt like the last time – like the building, the first half of his life, and all the wasted time were now beneath him, or behind him. Thom’s reasonable self was afraid and begging for sanity because he assumed there was only one way anything would be changed tonight.

He let the wind and the remnants of his sanity argue, tuning both out; he hoped that with each side of his unending dispute distracted by the other, he could observe the situation from a neutral third-party perspective. He turned to face a glow from behind, an illuminated sign that towered over even he who had conquered the mountain. *“Crossroads Inc. – Real Solutions, Real Results”.* Slowly, he turned away from the light, playing and replaying the slogan in his mind, and admired the edge of the rooftop. *Real solutions.* No more curtain wall. *Real results.* No more self-driven agony. With a breeze of solace pushing against his back, he very slowly walked toward it. It was just what made the most sense.

*Wait.* He thought about his car. He thought about his apartment. He thought about his job and the other washers. He thought about schools of ignorant fish without long-term memories, swimming irrelevantly in small, mirrored tanks which look like oceans from the inside. He thought about the little boy behind the mirror, face pressed against the glass, watching in envy and fantasy. He thought about the impossibility of the child’s dreams, the trauma he’d experience when the world would inevitably shed its shroud of magic and mystery, exposing its demon face and splayed claws. When dreams and fantasy are lost forever – wasted time.

But now he *was* that little boy. The euphoric fulfillment he felt on the top of the building, the abandonment of the tangible world to a place where happiness and love are free, and flow as vastly and abundantly as the waters of the Earth, was all that mattered. This time, however, the demon had strangled Thom’s humility, and he decided he would get to feel this way longer; he decided he would feel this way for the rest of his life.

There are two well-known situations when time will slow: the first is impatient boredom, and the second is, of course, falling. The winds whispers accelerated to screams.

*****

*104, 103, 102, 101…* **Relief.**
It was ending. Childish excitement gathered in his throat to the surprise of even him. Thomas Pratt was finally happy with the direction of his life. As depressing as the context may have been, he was finally in control and dreams really had come true. But had they? A familiar voice. The voice of reason. He’d forgotten to start listening again.

*81, 80, 79, 78…* **Fear.**
Was this really necessary? Had he found the solution or merely gotten lost in the moment? His excitement dispersed and was replaced by a strangled gasp of panic, like waking from a dream and landing in a nightmare. Had he thrown it all away on a bad mood, a moment of weakness, a cluttered perspective? Now all hopes of rectification were completely lost.

*63, 62, 61, 60…* **Anger.**
This was all because of Crossroads! The glass people! Pratt hated them passionately. Could they see him now? They would have to see the ugly mess on their polished marble steps tomorrow morning. With disgusting pleasure he envisioned the twisted expressions of horror his remains would elicit upon their beautiful existence. They had put him up there, alone with the wind, that treacherous wind. It brought the dust. The very grime that had put his entire life to waste. A film of dirt that had collected so slowly over so long that he hadn’t realized what it was amounting to, and now it had finally smothered his flame. He himself had become nothing more than a helpless fleck of dust in the wind.

*39, 38, 37, 36…* **Harmony.**
When put into perspective, it no longer seemed to matter. What would he be missing out on? The squeegee. The rusty Geo. The TV Dinners. The lonely 19th street apartment. The wind. The people behind the glass. Old age. That was his life, and all were things that made him miserable. Collectively, they were what put him where he was, what made him who he was. They were the problem he was presently trying to solve.

*17, 16, 15, 14…*
Or was he just finally admitting defeat? With that thought, Thom once again asked himself, more inquisitively than he ever had or ever would: Was this really necessary?

*10, 9, 8…*
He thought about work and the Crossroads building. He remembered the feeling he got staring up at the building. It was how he felt now, reflecting upon his existence.

*7, 6, 5…* 
How was it that he could clean the film from the curtain wall but not from his own life?

*3, 2, 1.* **Epiphany.**
And then, like a set of polished marble steps, it hit him: dip, soap, flip, stroke. The only way he’d ever cleaned or accomplished anything was when he wasn’t distracted. He’d had a nasty habit of always looking either up at the mountain from its foot in a pool of dread, or down at his supposed solution in dreamy defeat. All the while, he should have been looking at what was directly in front of him, the true means for an end: a window that needed cleaning – a matter of dip, soap, flip, and stroke – the only thing he had ever done well. He was so overwhelmed by the mountain, his entire situation, that he forgot scaling it was just a sequence of much smaller, simpler steps. He should have approached his life as he would 1118 Watercrest Avenue: one eight by six foot segment at a time. The squeegee, the car, the glass people, all the things that made him who he was... they were all just windows. 

*And I was the Washer.*

*****

A mountain crumbles to a fatal dust, a mirror shatters into shards of murky glass, and another lost soul drowns in this loveless wasteland. His blood and tears now flow through the ocean he so foolishly sought, and the fish still swim irrelevantly, sustained by their neglect to see why those lavish waters will never dry.

Dip, soap, flip, and stroke;
Love, dream, live, and breathe;
For we know not what tomorrow’s winds may carry.
